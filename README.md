## Description
#### Info
The Developer's Best Friend is a software development tool to generate two types of demo data. First, Lorem Ipsum random text may be generated according to the number of words, sentences, or paragraphs specified. Second, random user data may be generated according to the available choices of data fields and quantity of users. This application was depeveloped using the Laravel 5 framework.

#### Validation
Validation is performed using Bootstrap form validation in the frontend and Laravel form validation in the backend.

#### Task Runner
##### Development
This application uses NPM, Gulp, and Laravel's Elixir for the task runner workflow:
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies to the `node_modules` directory.
2. Run `gulp` to compile, bundle, and version all Sass/CSS and JavaScript into the `build/` directory.
##### Production
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies to the `node_modules` directory.
2. Run `gulp --production` to not only bundle and version all Sass/CSS and JavaScript, but also remove intermediary bundles and directories.**
